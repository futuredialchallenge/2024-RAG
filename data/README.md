# Mobile Customer-Service Dialog Dataset 2 (MobileCS2)

## Data Description
The 1st FutureDial challenge at EMNLP 2022 focused on building semi-supervised and reinforced task-oriented dialog systems ([FutureDial-SereTOD](http://seretod.org/)), and released a large-scale human-human dialog dataset MobileCS1 (Mobile Customer Service). 

The 2nd FutureDial challenge focuses on building dialog systems with RAG, with the following features:

- We release a new dataset from the China Mobile customer-service logs (MobileCS2) that contains both labeled and unlabeled data.
There are a total of 6K dialog logs, with nearly 3K carefully annotated. We encourage the study of semi-supervised RAG-based dialog systems. 
- The dataset enables the study of building dialog systems with knowledge base queries and API calls.
- The dataset is available in both *Chinese* and *English* versions to the public, so that researchers around the world can experiment with this dataset.
